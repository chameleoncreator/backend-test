# Chameleon Creator Code Challenge Ruby on Rails 

This is a ruby on rails code challenge. It is a simple todo application. 

## Installation

standard rails using 6.0.2.1. Make sure you have node >= 10 installed to run webpacker which is needed from 
the front end.

basic install:

```
bundle install 
yarn install 
rails s 
```
---

it uses the basic rails new with webpack=react and a couple of front end library and devise for auth.

The challenge involves 2 parts, a quick read and understand and a small amount of coding. We are looking 
to see how well you can understand and work with rails, and also how you think about what you are doing.

## Part 1. 

Read through the app and get an understanding of how its setup

Jot down 2 - 3 points that you like about it, or has been done well, and why

Jot down 2 - 3 points about what you would do to move the app forward without adding any new features and why. 

## Part 2. 

Fork the repo and create a new branch. 

Implement 1 or more feature of your choice. Don't spend more than hour or 2  on it, 
just enough so that you think you have showed us what you can do. 

The key is try and focus on what you think could provide an end user value.

You can submit a question as an issue on the github

Once you have finished, submit a pull request. 

NOTE: if you can't get it running, just write some code and pretend that it works. 
more interested in seeing your code rather than having working code.
